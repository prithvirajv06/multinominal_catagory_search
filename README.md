# NLP Business Category Classification

This repository contains code for training a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify text into different business categories. The model is based on a Naive Bayes classifier using TF-IDF features.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a text classification model that can predict the business category based on user input. The model is trained on a dataset containing texts and their corresponding business categories. The classification is performed using a Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is available in the `dataset` folder. It includes synthetic examples across three business categories: Technology, Food, and Clothing. Feel free to replace it with your own dataset if needed.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**

   Run the `train_model.py` script to train the Naive Bayes classifier and save the TF-IDF vectorizer and classifier models.

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Testing the Model:**

   Update the `test_model.py` script with your own test inputs and run it to check the model's predictions.

   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

## REST API

The repository includes a simple Flask-based REST API for making predictions using the trained model. To run the API, execute the following command:

```bash
python api.py
```

The API exposes a `/predict` endpoint that accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing the input text.

Example:

```json
{
  "text": "I'm interested in learning about artificial intelligence."
}
```

## Dependencies

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- joblib
